# Understanding Design Patterns with TypeScript

This repository explores fundamental design patterns using TypeScript, featuring straightforward code examples and relatable scenarios to enhance your comprehension.

## Singleton Pattern

ðŸ”— **Explanation:**
The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a single point of access to it.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**
Imagine a configuration manager handling global settings in a web application. By utilizing the Singleton Pattern, you ensure that there's only one configuration manager instance managing all the settings.

## Factory Pattern

ðŸ”— **Explanation:**
The Factory Pattern creates objects without specifying their exact classes.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**
Consider a scenario where you're designing a game with various enemy types. By employing the Factory Pattern, you can create enemies without worrying about their specific implementations, allowing for easier expansion and maintenance.

## Adapter Pattern

ðŸ”— **Explanation:**
The Adapter Pattern bridges incompatible interfaces for smooth interaction.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**
Imagine a situation where a new payment gateway needs to interface with an existing payment processing system. An adapter can be used to convert the new gateway's methods into a format that the existing system understands.

## Strategy Pattern

ðŸ”— **Explanation:**
The Strategy Pattern defines interchangeable algorithms.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**
Think of a navigation app offering different route options. With the Strategy Pattern, you can easily switch between algorithms for calculating routes based on user preferences.

## Composite Pattern

ðŸ”— **Explanation:**
The Composite Pattern organizes objects into tree structures.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**
Consider a file system where directories contain files or subdirectories. By applying the Composite Pattern, you can treat individual files and directories uniformly, simplifying operations like counting total file sizes.

## Template Method Pattern

ðŸ”— **Explanation:**
The Template Method Pattern defines the structure of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**
Imagine a document generation system where different types of documents need to be formatted. By using the Template Method Pattern, you can define a standardized document generation process while allowing customization for each document type.

## Observer Pattern

ðŸ”— **Explanation:**
The Observer Pattern establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**
Think of a stock market monitoring system where investors receive real-time updates about their portfolio. By applying the Observer Pattern, the system can efficiently notify multiple investors whenever stock prices change.

## Decorator Pattern

ðŸ”— **Explanation:**
The Decorator Pattern adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**
Consider a text editing application where users can apply different formatting styles (bold, italic, underline) to text. The Decorator Pattern allows users to add and remove formatting dynamically without altering the original text content.
